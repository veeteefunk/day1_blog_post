            Hi everyone, my name is Victor Marin Viloria and I have decided to dedicate my entire
            summer to coding. I needed to refresh some web programming fundamental concepts, and
            this project also gives me the opportunity to design exercises for everyone who is
            beginning his/her coding journey.
        </p><br>
        <p>I am going to make a website each day along with providing a mini-lesson on the concepts
            I have had to study and implement. The posts on this blog will contain these lessons
            with a couple of exercises for you to do and practice.
        </p><br>
        <p>I am a true believer in the power of consistency, so I really hope this project helps me 
            get back in programming shape along with your help. Your feedback is important, so if 
            you ever think that I could have done something better let me know!
        </p><br>
        <p>This project starts today and I hope you will join on this adventure. I am sure this will 
            help me become a better developer, writer and teacher. I am sure this will be hard to pull off,
            I know I'll get frustrated, but in the end my vision remains fixed on my one and only goal:
            to become a better person.
